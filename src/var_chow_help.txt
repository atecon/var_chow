This package computes the Chow-test on parameter constancy for a reduced-form VAR model for A) a specific break date or B) every datapoint as done in JMULTI. It is assumed that every break point is known.

NOTE: Option B does not refer to the Andrews-Ploberger approach. Here, as in
JMULTI, every date is tested for a break.

Three tests are applied (for further references see LÃ¼tkepohl et al (2007), pp. 135):
1. Break-point test
2. Sample-split test
3. Forecast-test

Please ask questions and report bugs on the gretl mailing list if possible. Alternatively, create an issue ticket on the github repo (see below).

Public function:
----------------

Function:       var_chow(list Y, list X, int Rob, int p, string breakd,
                         int rep, string plotname)

Description:    Main function for computing Chow test

Arguments:
  Y:      list, list of endogenous variables
  X:      list, list of exogenous variables (e.g. trend or dummies).
  Rob:    int, Select robust standard errors: "1" non-robust S.E., "2" HC
          S.E., "3" to HAC S.E.
  p:      int, Select max. lag length of the VAR(p) model.
  breakd: string, Select (i) a specific break date to test (e.g. "1983:1")
          or (ii) check every possible data point ('every', default).
  rep:    int, Set the number of bootstrap iterations.
  plotname: string, 'display' returns immediate plot on screen; or define a
            path + filename where to save the output (e.g. plotname
            '<DIR>\chow.pdf' will compile a pdf-file named 'chow_bp.pdf' in the
            respective folder.

Return:
 Returns a vector (1x7) with the following test outputs in the following order:
 chowout: "tstat_ss df_ss tstat_bp df_bp tstat_fc df_fc1 df_fc2"
 1. Test statistics sample-split test
 2. DF of sample-split test
 3. Test statistics break-point test
 4. DF of break-point test
 5. Test statistics of forecast test
 6. DF1 of forecast test
 7. DF2 of forecast test
